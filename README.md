# Laguna3Navigation
A custom navigation for Renault Laguna III, replacing the screen with an Android device that comunicates with the multimedia CAN.

The main ideea is to gather the multimedia CAN data using an arduino and a CAN module. After that, we send the information (modified) to the Android device (in this instance, I chose a Nexus 7 2013), where we will have an app that show's us the Radio's information.

There will be constant updates, since the project is still in work. Any insight or ideeas are welcomed.
